Simple REST API in Play - @martinsahlen's first stab at Scala
-----------------------
As I am pretty experienced in building REST APIs in python, java and javascript, it is time to
learn something new. Let's see how deep the rabbit hole goes.

The main focus that I have is
* Managing DB (Using Plain old SQL and anorm)
* Managing input validation (Using Play's Json parsers and validators)
* Managing Authentication and authorization (using Play actions and action compositions)
* To have fun!

Based on the activator [template](https://typesafe.com/activator/templates) for implementing Json based [REST API](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/ScalaJsonHttp)
and more specifically This repo: [https://github.com/amitdev/simple-rest-scala](https://github.com/amitdev/simple-rest-scala#master)
